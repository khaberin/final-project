    <p>Well it is a nautical term, it's a vessel larger than a boat for transporting people or goods by sea... Ha. Funny. No but really, Urban Dictionary describes a "ship" as "a term used to describe fan fictions that take previously created characters and put them as a pair. It usually refers to romantic relationships, but it can refer platonic ones as well". So when you hear "ship", just think relationship. There's also OTP (one true pairing) which is your ideal match made in heaven for fictional characters across the boards. Mine is a Buffy OTP so you'll see that fangirling when you get to that page for sure. I will not hold back. </p>

<h2 class="joss">Joss Whedon</h2>    
<img src="img/joss.jpg" class="josspic" alt="joss"/>    
<p>This man is a god, everything he creates is so incredible and unlike anything you've ever experienced in your television-watching life. Think I'm, over-selling him? Well I'm not. Firefly, Dollhouse, Angel, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer are all incredible pieces of work.</p>    
<p>His real name is actually Joseph, but c'mon, Joss sound infinitely cooler. He's been working since 1989 and he just directed the latest Avengers film. He is mostly known for science fiction/supernatural drama projects. He also created Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog during the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike. It's a hilarious story that features Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion and the lovely Felicia Day. Joss tends to cast a lot of the same actors in his different projects (rightly so, they are amazing) and it's interesting to see them grow from the early 2000's to today. He's been nominated for several awards and has won for his work with Dr.Horrible's Sing Along Blog as well as for directing the Avengers.</p>
<p>As well as working with television and film, Joss also wrote for some of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Marvel comics. So essentially he is a Jack of all trades. </p>    
    
<h1 class="index">Why Buffy?<span class="fa fa-trophy" "icon"></span></h1>
<img src="img/castgif.gif" class="castgif"/>    
    
<p>I have a slight obsession with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Okay a <strong>major</strong> obsession. But this show, even though it ended close to 13 years ago, still has a cult following today. So I'm not alone! Buffy fans are amazing and loyal as ever to Joss the creator and what the show really stood for. And this can make them a little, well, scary to non-believers.The relationships of the show, for me personally, are so diverse and transcendent and there is a character for every viewer (mine's Tara <span class="fa fa-smile-o"></span>). In my 21 years of existence I've never watched a show that has taught me so much about life and made me comfortable with who I am as a unique individual. I've watched the show from season one to seven at least four times completely (not counting the episodes or even scenes that I can rewatch on a daily basis). Yeah, it's that good. </p>
