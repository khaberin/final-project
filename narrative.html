   <p> For my final project I have created a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fansite that focuses on the many relationships throughout the series (hence the name, Sunnydale ‘Ships). I really wanted this site to have a more comic book/sci-fi sort of feel to it to mirror what the show is kind of about. My navigation bar on the top of my page is a series of buttons rather than a navbar. I chose this way so I could customize it the way I wanted to with the style sheet I found online through Bootstrap. This buttons definitely have the pop of a comic book. I also utilized drop down boxes for almost all the buttons to create an organized way of going through the website. My footer is also a HTML coding feat for me. I was able to utilize the marquee tag to have my little ship logo and the name of my site continually scroll across the bottom of the page.</p>
	<p>I definitely ran into some issues just by the sheer magnitude of my project. I was getting fourteen photos for every relationship and I had about twelve relationships so that was almost one hundred and seventy different images/gifs I needed not including the images and gifs I used for the homepage and navigation bar. So that was really time consuming for me but I really enjoyed the final project and the movement to gifs brought to every page. I definitely saved time by using the same format for almost every page of my site. So I was able to copy and paste and just change the content for most of my pages.</p> 
	<p>Another small issue I ran into was the quality of images I found. Buffy the Vampire Slayer aired over a decade ago, so a lot of the images I found weren’t the best quality. And I’m kind of a perfectionist so if the image quality was bad or it did not resize nicely to the size I wanted to I would need to go back to Google or Bing and loot for another image. There was also no real opportunity to find the specific images I wanted for my website on Flickr or any other Creative Commons platform. </p>
	<p>Since I looked up a lot of tags and methods online and had a lot of content on every page, validating my HTML was a real pain. Just because I had a ton of elements on every page, it was really hard to see if I missed a tag or didn’t close a div. And it seemed that when I fixed one error another two or three surfaced. This was definitely a lot different than validating a small-scale project we did for class that had maybe four different elements. Since I copied and pasted a lot of my code from one HTML from another, if I messed up somewhere I then had to fix that one error ten or eleven more times, which got annoying and tedious.</p>  
	<p>I really relied on looking up different elements online that we did not explicitly learned in class. It was a fun challenge to implement these new elements and having to tweak them and add my own style so it appeared the way that I envisioned it for my website. I definitely wanted my website to have a 90s feel as well as a darker sense that the show really encompasses.</p>
	<p>I really enjoyed the freedom this project allowed me. I really enjoy writing and being creative in that way so when I paired that with something I’m really excited about, like my favorite television show, I knew I would produce something I could read over and enjoy. I’m very informal and relaxed in my writing, so being able to be informal instead of doing a professional portfolio like most people were, I was able to have a lot of fun and enjoyed coding on a Friday night. </p>
